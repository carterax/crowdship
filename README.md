## Contract üìù

- Contract documentation on methods, events and variables can be found [here](https://github.com/carterax/crowdship/tree/main/docs).
- Crowdship UI - https://github.com/carterax/crowdship-v1-interface
- Crowdship Subgraph - https://github.com/carterax/crowdship-v1-subgraph

## Quick Start ‚ö°Ô∏è

To work on the contracts locally there are a few requirements

- [Node.js v12+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Ganache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

In the terminal, clone https://github.com/carterax/crowdship and install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/carterax/crowdship.git
cd crowdship
npm i
```

Compile and generate the contracts

```sh
npm run postinstall
```

#### Deploying to Ganache

After `npm run migrate` take note of the contract addresses returned in the terminal

```sh
ganache-cli --deterministic
npm run migrate
```

#### Interacting with the contracts on ganache

This opens up truffle console on the default development network; Open the console on rinkeby [scroll to scripts](https://github.com/carterax/crowdship#scripts-).

```sh
npm run truffle-console
factory = await Factory.at("0x00") //replace 0x00 with your contract address
deployedCampaignCount = await factory.deployedCampaignCount()
```

### Deploying to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/)

Make sure you have [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) installed and setup

- In the select input under workspaces select `connect to localhost`, Follow the instruction given in the modal.
- Open and compile all contracts under `./contracts/*.sol` using `solc v0.8.0`
- Under compiler configuration enable `optimization` with a runs value of `1`, hit the compile button
- Under deploy & run transactions from the select dropdown, choose `Injected web3`
- Deploy `Factory.sol` `CampaignFactory.sol` `CampaignReward.sol` and `Campaign.sol`, after deploying these contracts please take note of their addresses as they would be required for various implementations across some contracts.
- After deployment you can now interact with the contract methods üéâ

## Running tests ‚úÖ

Ensure ganche is running

```sh
npm run test
```
